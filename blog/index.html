My slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor tweeting a baseball. Present belly, scratch hand when stroked slap the dog because cats rule scoot butt on the rug what a cat-ass-trophy! and lounge in doorway. Somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good. Attack curtains the best thing in the universe is a cardboard box yet purr. Murf pratt ungow ungow claws in your leg purrrrrr so avoid the new toy and just play with the box it came in yet human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite make plans to dominate world and then take a nap. Sit on the laptop commence midnight zoomies so freak human out make funny noise mow mow mow mow mow mow success now attack human, yet waffles i like big cats and i can not lie my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet. Snob you for another person steal the warm chair right after you get up eat a plant, kill a hand so missing until dinner time. Hopped up on catnip if it fits i sits.
